Collective</span> is a collaborative of over 60 organitations and youth leaders working to prevent and end youth homelessness in Miami-Dade County. The H.O.M.Y. Collective believes that no young person should spend a single night sleeping outdoors simply because they do not have access to safe housing.  Our work is driven by the shared goal of ensuring that youth homelessness is rare, brief, and when it does occur, a one-time experience. Through its partner organizations, The H.O.M.Y. Collective provides support and services to youth and young adults between the ages of 13-24 who are experiencing housing instability or in a vulnerable housing situation. Our core areas of support are Stable Housing, Education, Employment, Primary and Behavioral Healthcare, and Permanent Connections.
